# Challenge 032: Wrapping Paper

## Challenge

This week’s challenge is borrowed from [Advent of Code: Day 2](http://adventofcode.com/day/2), as featured on The Buzz.

Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the 
dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping 
paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is `2 * l * w + 2 * w * h + 2 * h * l`. The 
elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

For example:

    A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2 * 6 + 2 * 12 + 2 * 8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square 
    feet  of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.
    
    A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2 * 1 + 2 * 10 + 2 * 10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square 
    foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.

All numbers in the elves’ list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
